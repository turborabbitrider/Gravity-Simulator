# Gravity-Simulator
A simple simulator of gravity forces aplied on planet models. The project cannot be used in the play mode, I only carried experiments in the development environment adjusting the scene to watch the effects.
 I've done it to learn Unity, also I like physics, so i found that topic interesting and not very complicated, it was perfect to learn new environment.
 I added sun and five first planets form the solar system, keeping the ratios between masses, densities and distances from sun. The simulation changes sizes of planets calculated of average density and mass of the planet. Starting speeds of the planets can also be adjusted, but without any energy loss if the speed is not big enough to break the escape velocity of the sun planets will travel around sun, and won't leave the gravity field.
 At the moment i have no interest in further development of this project. I might make a game out of it, but if I do it would be in the future when I finish projects that I'm currently working on. 
Here's a link to video of the simulation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v0KKoLLMiY&t=65s
